        "description": "Let us show you the wonderful southern skies. Coonabarabran is the Astronomy Capital of Australia - we have the Warrumbungle Dark Sky Park - Siding Spring Observatory and wonderful dark skies. At Milroy Observatory we have the historic Siding Spring Observatory 40inch telescope - it was the first telescope on the Mountain in 1963 and since 2014 has been located at Milroy Observatory. It is the largest publicly available telescope in the country. Let Donna the Astronomer - our local comet discoverer, amateur and  professional astronomer show you the wonders of our dark southern skies. Let her share her passion and love of the sky with you as you learn about the constellations, sky lore and all kinds of astronomical trivia and information. She loves to answer questions and share her knowledge. The show is mostly outside - see the stars with your own eyes, see 'fuzzy' objects through binoculars and see them come to life - look through our other \"not so small portable\" telescopes and finish off with a view through the historic 40inch telescope. We keep our groups manageable so everyone gets to have a good time! Bookings are essential.\nCheck us out on Facebook:"
